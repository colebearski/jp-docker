    <h1>Dock and Door Service</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>Overhead Doors</h2>
    <p>
      At JP Docker, we employ a dedicated staff to handle all types of overhead
      sectional and coiling doors. First and foremost, we understand
      distribution and production environments, especially the importance of
      getting repairs completed quickly, so your doors can be used to conduct
      your daily business.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>High Speed Doors</h2>
    <p>
      We have factory trained technicians for Rytec and Dynaco high speed doors.
      These doors are always in an important pathway for business operations (in
      fact, usually your highest traffic patterns). We understand that these
      doors need to be operational to control the environments that they guard.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Dock Levelers</h2>
    <p>
      Our team of dock and door technicians have been factory trained and
      understand maintenance and repair for all types of dock levelers, which
      include hydraulic, air, mechanical, power assisted and edge of dock
      levelers. We even handle the more complicated power conversion systems to
      change the old worn out mechanical leveler to power assisted or airbag
      operation. Docks are a critical path for any distribution center and
      response time for a repair on a dock leveler is critical, so we have
      dedicated teams that have primary responsibility to keep this equipment in
      solid working order.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      We’re the experts when it comes to dock and doors. Our inventory of parts
      and database of clients’ products keep repair time to a minimum. One of
      the most important features, that no one else offers your business, is the
      HOJ | CARES program.
